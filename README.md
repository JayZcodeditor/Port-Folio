## 🌟 Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind + Vercel + Express + JavaScript + MongoDB Project

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of using **Vue 3** with **MongoDB**, along with deploying it on a hosting service like **Vercel**. The project has been successfully connected to MongoDB and provides a smooth experience from development to deployment.

---

### 🚀 Project Setup and Configuration

1. **📦 Initialize with Vite**
   - Create a new Vite project using the command:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest
     ```
   - Select **Vue** as the framework during setup.

2. **🎨 Install Tailwind CSS**
   - To set up Tailwind CSS, run the following commands:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
     npx tailwindcss init -p
     ```

3. **🔧 Install Node Modules**
   - After initializing, install the required node modules:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **🛠 Environment Setup**
   - Create environment files:
     - `.env` for local development.
     - `.env.production` for deployment on Vercel.
   - Create `apisetting.js` to call environment variables and use them in the frontend API configuration.

5. **🔄 Configure Vercel for Deployment**
   - Create a `vercel.json` file to define routes and API paths:
     ```json
     {
       "rewrites": [
         { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/index.js" },
         { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
       ]
     }
     ```

6. **🗄️ Set Up MongoDB**
   - Create an account on **MongoDB Atlas** and set up a cloud database.
   - Use the provided **MongoDB connection URL** for API configuration in `index.js`.

7. **✅ Deployment Complete!**
   - With everything in place, you’re ready to deploy the project on **Vercel**.

### 💡 Key Concepts in Vue 3

The project separates routing into two main parts:

1. **🖥️ Frontend Routes**  
   - Managed in `router.js`, where paths like `/<path>` are defined to display specific components.

2. **🔌 API Routes**  
   - Located in the `api` folder, with `index.js` as the entry point for MongoDB connection and API route setup.
   - Includes configuration for **MongoDB**, **CORS**, **Express**, and **PORT** settings.
   - Routes are defined to call backend functions using `userRoute` for MongoDB operations.

### 🌍 Deployment with Vercel

- Vercel automatically connects to your repository and deploys the Vue project.
- The build process is defined in `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
  }
